# K-Nearest-NEIGHBOUR-KNN-ALGORITHM-
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and data sets given. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Nowadays machine learning keeps solving on a different fields category problems such as: Computational finance, Image processing and computer vision, Computational biology, Energy production, Automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, Natural language processing (NLP). Nowadays Machine learning algorithms find natural patterns in data that generate insight and help you make better decisions and predictions. In Machine Learning models it allow the user to make predictions from the past DATA available.
