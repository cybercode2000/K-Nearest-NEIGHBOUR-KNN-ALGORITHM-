# K-Nearest-NEIGHBOUR-KNN-ALGORITHM-
KNN means K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. KNN is the simplest supervised machine learning algorithm mostly used for classification of data. Before moving on to KNN, let's look at machine learning briefly and the category that KNN falls under.

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and data sets given. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Nowadays, machine learning keeps solving on a different fields category problems such as: Computational Finance, Image Processing and Computer Vision, Computational Biology, Energy Production, Automotive, Aerospace, and Manufacturing, Natural Language Processing (NLP). Nowadays, These techniques find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. it helps us to generate insight and help us to make better decisions and predictions. In Machine Learning models it allow the user to make predictions from the past DATA available.
